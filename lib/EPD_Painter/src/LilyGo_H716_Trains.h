// LilyGo_H716_Trains.h — every waveform the LilyGo T5 4.7" EPD47 H716 drives.
//
// One file per board: the 4-level waveform pairs (FAST/NORMAL/HIGH), the
// 16-grey decision-engine tables, and the grey-to-grey direct trains. The
// preset in EPD_Painter_presets.h carries pins and timing only and points
// here; auto-detection therefore selects these tables with the board. A
// tuned blob in NVS (see EPD_Painter_tuned.h and examples/other/tuneup)
// overrides them at begin().
//
// Everything below was measured on one H716 panel with the self-tuning rig
// (examples/other/tuneup, flatbed scanner in the loop): the 16-grey NORMAL
// and 4-level NORMAL tables on 28 July 2026; the FAST 4-level pair, its
// direct trains, and the 16-grey HIGH tables on 30 July. All at the
// preset's timing: 20 ms pass period, 4 us row charge, 1000 ns LE (FAST has
// no configurable period — 7 undelayed passes always). The tables are
// valid ONLY at that timing.
//
// Every set here is complete and wired in EPD_Painter_presets.h. The one
// gap is not a missing table but a Config limitation: there is a single
// level_lum4 pointer shared by FAST and 4-grey NORMAL, so only FAST's
// measured curve can be installed (see LEVEL_LUM4_H716_FAST below).

// FAST pair evolved from scratch (blobs erased) 30 July 2026 by pair-
// evolution (tuner_evo4.h), levels worst 8.7 units, all 6/6 directs
// converged. The FIRST attempt that session collapsed L1/L2 toward white
// (measured curve 255 255 253 0): evoPairFitness's cubed ghost term is
// right at 16 greys, where losing one of fifteen levels to caution is a
// minor cost, but at FAST's only two free levels it made "barely move
// ink" the fitness-optimal answer. evo4PairFitness (SQUARE, not cube, on
// the residual) fixed it — see tuner_evo4.h. L2's apply now carries a
// deliberate embedded whiten (mixed with darkens, not a pure run); nets
// +4/+5/+7 for L1/L2/L3, still DC-balanced against each remove.
//
// NORMAL pair scanner-tuned 28 July 2026 against the corrected dose
// ladder (worst 6.3 units against an 8.0 tolerance, erase residual 6.4)
// — a plain darken run, this panel's undelayed first passes being
// strong enough that no whiten trim was needed.
//
// The HIGH 4-level pair is the 22 July dithertune set, untouched: the
// HIGH_4 combination has never been through the scanner rig.
